# :tomato: react-pomodoro-clock :tomato:

## Intro :rocket:
This year, at the age of 30, I discovered that I have ADHD. 
This discovery enlightened me on several things that I felt during my life but could not explain. However, 
it also brought me a new task: now that I knew what my difficulty was, I had to learn to control it or work around it.


When reading a bit more about my condition, I learned about the Pomodoro technique and how it could help with concentration and focus. 
With that in mind, I decided to take advantage of the fact that I had just started studying React and then code a Pomodoro Clock 
in order to understand a little more how the library works and, at the same time, create a useful application for my daily life.

It was a fun exercise and, at the end of the day, if I end up not getting used to the technique, 
at least I could understand myself a little more and learn something from it.

## Resources :hammer_and_wrench:
- React Circular Progressbar -> https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-circular-progressbar
- Heroicons -> https://heroicons.com/
- Original model made by Dawid Paszko (https://github.com/dejwid) -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1tjrnX160k

## Next Steps :bookmark_tabs:
- Implement React Router instead of a variable to switch between the Clock and the Settings screen;
- Trigger sounds when changing from work time to break time;
- Apply a gradient to the progress bar path;
- Create preset buttons for short, medium or long Pomodoros;
- Style the app to make it unique.
